Physical Controller: Alarm Clock

Concept: Waking up the sleeping man who’s late for work by activating his alarm.

Behavior: A picture of a man sleeping is displayed, when you touch the alarm he wakes up angry with alarm sounds blazing until you remove your hand from the sensor on top of the clock.

Issues: I struggled with getting the alarm to play because the draw loop kept restarting the sound but I ended up creating an if statement before playing so it doesn’t keep repeating.
