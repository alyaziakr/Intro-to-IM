Computer Vision:

I’ve always wondered how computer visions works, especially with the projects done around campus. I even went to Abu Dhabi Art a few days ago and there was an interactive computer-based art work and I got the chance to chat with the programmer about the software he used and how he was able to achieve the effect he did and this reading helped solidify the idea in my mind, it now seems like something feasible for me to make especially with the techniques mentioned. I noticed that with the art work I visited I understand why optimizing the environment along side the algorithm is important. Since the algorithm is hard enough, making the environment controlled helps make the coding part of it easier to be able to make the computer vision work properly. The thing that I’ve taken most out of this reading was the optimization of the users environment in order to make this work. For the art work I visited it, the artist and programer had a blank background, a line on the ground for people to stand behind and had the entire installation in its own room.
